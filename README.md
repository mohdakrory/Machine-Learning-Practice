# Machine Learning Practice 

This repository comprises illustrative examples showcasing the application of traditional machine learning algorithms across various datasets to address diverse tasks.

## Diamond price prediction: 

Building a regression model that predicts the price of a diamond based on its characteristics

This Example consists of:

- Dataset description and visualization using Matplotlib and Pandas profile report 
- Label encoding of ordinal features
- Feature scaling using a MinMax scaler
- Fitting different Regressors and result comparison
- Creating a preprocessing function to make predictions on a new observation (Deployment)

## Customer segmentation 

Dividing customer data into 5 clusters for personalized marketing purposes 

This Example consists of:

- Dataset description and visualization using Matplotlib and Pandas profile report 
- Label encoding of ordinal features
- Feature scaling using a MinMax scaler
- Fitting different Regressors and result comparison
- Creating a preprocessing function to make predictions on a new observation (Deployment)
